**Conclusion**

The more the person is active.ie.the more time he spends being active the more calories he burns. Calories burnt is directly proportional to the number of steps taken and the distance covered. Looking at the graph it is pretty clear that people burnt more calories on the days they were more active and they had better sleep as well, which sums up our theory that being more active will not only help us maintain good helath, but it will be beneficial at work as well as we would be more productive due to better sleep.
